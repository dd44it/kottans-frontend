I already have basic knowledge about git and used common patterns in the small study projects. But I would share smth new for me commands <b> git diff </b> : show all changes in the project and has similar feature with additional tags for example <b> git diff --staged </b>: show staged changes; <b> git rm [name file] </b> : delete file from project; <b> git mv [old_file.js] [new_file.js] </b> : rename file; <b> git add -a -m "comment commit" </b> : fast way to commit changes; <b> git log --graph --oneline </b> : shows git history project
